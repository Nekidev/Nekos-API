# Reference

This page will help you understand how to use the Rest API. We highly recommend reading this before starting to use the API.

## Ratelimits

The API has a rate limit of **2 requests per second**. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 response. You can use the Retry-After header to determine how long to wait before retrying.

## Authentication

The API does not require any kind of authentication. You can go ahead and start using it right away.

## Pagination

The API uses a limit/offset based pagination system. You can use the limit and offset query parameters to paginate through the results. For example:

```
GET /api/image?limit=10&offset=0 HTTP/1.1
```

The default limit is 10 and the maximum limit is 25.

## Errors

If an error occurs, the API will return a JSON object with the following structure:

```js
{
    "code": Integer,
    "message": String
}
```
