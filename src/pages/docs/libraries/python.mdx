# Python 3

The [`anime-api`](https://pypi.org/project/anime-api) library is an officially supported Python 3 wrapper for Nekos API.

Source code: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nekidev/anime-api)

## Installation

The `anime-api` library can be installed on Python 3.7 and higher using pip, Poetry or Conda.

<Tabs items={["Pip", "Poetry", "Conda"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        pip install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        poetry add anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        conda install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The `anime-api` library contains lots of wrappers for different APIs, but we'll focus on the `NekosAPI(){:python}` class. You can import it from the `anime_api.apis` module.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
```

### Get a random image

The `NekosAPI(){:python}` class has a `get_random_image(){:python}` method that returns a random image.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 images with the `kemonomimi` category
image = nekos.get_random_image(categories=["kemonomimi"])

print(image.url)
```

You can also get many images (up to 25) at once using the `get_random_images(){:python}` method instead.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# The categories argument is optional. If not specified, the images will be
# completely random (no specific category)
images = nekos.get_random_images(limit=10, categories=["kemonomimi"])

for image in images:
    print(image.url)
```

### Get an image by it's ID

Every image in the API has its own ID. You can fetch an image by its ID to get a specific image's information.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

image_id = "some-uuid"
image = nekos.get_image_by_id(image_id=image_id)

assert image.id == image_id
print(image.url)
```

### Get all artists

If you want to get all artists available, you can use the `get_artists(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 artists and skip the first 5. By default the limit
# is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0.
artists = nekos.get_artists(limit=10, offset=0)

for artist in artists:
    print(artist.name)
```

### Get an artist by it's ID

Each artist in the API has its ID. Although every image comes with (almost) all its artist information, fetching an artist by its ID has its advantages.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

artist_id = "some-uuid"
artist = nekos.get_artist_by_id(artist_id=artist_id)

assert artist.id == artist_id
print(artist.images)
```

As you can see, the `images` property is added to the `Artist` object when it's fetched by ID. This is not the case if the artist is fetched using a different method.

### Get all artist's images

If you want to fetch an artist's images, you can use the `get_images_by_artist_id(){:python}` method. This method returns up to 25 images and supports pagination.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 images from arist with "some-uuid" as ID and skip
# the first 5. By default the limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0.
images = nekos.get_images_by_artist_id(artist_id="some-uuid", limit=10, offset=5)

for image in images:
    print(image.artist.name)
```

### Get all categories

To get a list of all categories available, you can use the `get_categories(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 categories and skip the first 5. By default the
# limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0.
categories = nekos.get_categories(limit=10, offset=0)

for category in categories:
    print(category)
```

### Get a category by it's ID

All categories have their unique ID, which is always returned together with the category. You can get a specific category using the `get_gategory_by_id(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

category_id = "some-uuid"
category = nekos.get_category_by_id(category_id=category_id)

assert category.id == category_id
print(category.name)
```

### Get character by it's ID

Every character has it's unique ID, which is returned together with the character in every API response. You can get a specific charcater's information using the `get_character_by_id(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

character_id = "some-uuid"
character = nekos.get_character_by_id(character_id=character_id)

assert character.id == character_id
print(character.name)
```
