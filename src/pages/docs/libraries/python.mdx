The [`anime-api`](https://github.com/Nekidev/anime-api) library is an officially supported Python 3 wrapper for Nekos API.

## Installation

The `anime-api` library can be installed on Python 3.7 and higher using pip, Poetry or Conda.

<Tabs items={['Pip', 'Poetry', 'Conda']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        pip install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        poetry add anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        conda install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The `anime-api` library contains lots of wrappers for different APIs, but we'll focus on the `NekosAPI(){:python}` class. You can import it from the `anime_api.apis` module.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
```

### Get a random image

The `NekosAPI(){:python}` class has a `get_random_image(){:python}` method that returns a random image.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
image = nekos.get_random_image(categories=["kemonomimi"])

print(image.url)
```

You can also get many images (up to 25) at once using the `get_random_images(){:python}` method instead.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
images = nekos.get_random_images(limit=10, categories=["kemonomimi"])

for image in images:
    print(image.url)
```

### Get an image by it's ID

Every image in the API has its own ID. You can fetch an image by its ID to get a specific image's information.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
image = nekos.get_image_by_id(image_id="some-uuid")

print(image.url)
```

### Get an artist by it's ID

Each artist in the API has its ID. Although every image comes with (almost) all its artist information, fetching an artist by its ID has its advantages.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
artist = nekos.get_artist_by_id(artist_id="some-uuid")

print(artist.images)
```

As you can see, the `images` property is added to the `Artist` object when it's fetched by ID.

### Get all artist's images

If you want to fetch an artist's images, you can use the `get_images_by_artist_id(){:python}` method. This method returns up to 25 images and supports pagination.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 images from arist with "some-uuid" as ID and skip
# the first 5. By default the limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0.
images = nekos.get_images_by_artist_id(artist_id="some-uuid", limit=10, offset=5)

for image in images:
    print(image.artist.name)
```

## Reference

### `class Image`

The `Image` object represents an image returned from the API. It has the following attributes:
- `url: str{:python}`: The URL of the image.
- `author: _Author{:python}`: The author of the image. It has a `name`, an `image` and a `url` attribute.
- `categories: List[str]{:python}`: A list of tags associated with the image.
- `nsfw: bool{:python}`: Whether the image is NSFW or not.
- `created_at: datetime.datetime{:python}`: The date and time when the image was created.
