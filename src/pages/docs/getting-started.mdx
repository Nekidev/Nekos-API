# Getting Started

This is not a tutorial on how to use the API, but rather a guide to help you get familiar with the API, its structure, and what you can and cannot do with the content provided. If you are looking for a tutorial on how to use the API, please refer to the **Reference** section for the [Rest API](/docs/rest-api/reference) docs or the [GraphQl](/docs/graphql/reference) docs.

## Images

The main purpose of this API is to serve random images. There are certain requisites that the images must follow in order to be served by the API. These are:

  * The image must have at least a HD resolution (1280x720 or 720x1280)
  * The image must not have any explicit content (nudity, gore, etc). We expand on this in the [NSFW](#nsfw) section.
  * The image must not be a meme or a joke.
  * The image must not have filters applied to it.

All the images are manually added and checked by our team. If you want to contribute to the API, please refer [here](/docs/contributing).

We try to provide all the information we can about the images, such as the source, the artist, the categories, etc. If you find any image that is missing any of this information, please let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Nekidev/nekos-api/issues/new/choose) or contacting us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/b9Fv3kEfXc).

### NSFW

The API does not serve any explicit content. This means that the images will never contain nudity, gore, etc. However, there are some images that are borderline NSFW. These images are marked as such in the API and you must take care when using them.

#### NSFW levels

The API has 3 levels of NSFW:

  * `sfw`: Safe for work. These images are adequate for any audience.
  * `questionable`: These images are still SFW. They may contain some low suggestive content, but nothing explicit.
  * `nsfw`: These images are not safe for work. They will not contain any explicit content, but they may contain some suggestive content.

## Categories

Categories provide some extra description of the images. They are not meant to be used as tags, but rather as a way to group images that share some common characteristics. For example, all images that have one or more female characters have the `Girl` category.

Categories can be used in many ways:

  * To filter the images.
  * To provide a more detailed description of the image.

You'll see them in each image's response, together with their description and their nsfw level.

## Artists

We try to provide as much information as we can about the images. This includes the artist that created the image. We will always try to provide the artist's name, but sometimes we may not be able to find it. In these cases, we will provide the source of the image instead. If you find any unsourced image, please let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Nekidev/Nekos-API/issues/new).
