## Can I use Nekos API for commercial projects?

Yes, you can use Nekos API for commercial projects. We don't have any restrictions from us on that. However, <u>***we are NOT the copyright holders of the images provided***</u> and therefore we cannot license them to you. We try to provide the author of every image, but we can't guarantee that we have the correct information. If you want to use an image for commercial purposes, you should contact the author of the image.
