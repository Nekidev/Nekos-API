# About Nekos API

Nekos API is a free rest API for catgirl images and gifs. We try to provide the best service possible and we are always open to suggestions. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/b9Fv3kEfXc).

## Why Nekos API?

There are several reasons why you should use Nekos API:

-   **100% free**: No hidden costs.
-   **Fast by default**: We use a CDN to deliver images and gifs.
-   **Seamless integration**: We provide a simple but complete API that is easy to use.
-   **Begginner friendly**: We provide a simple documentation and a discord server to help you.
-   **Easy to use**: No struggling with authentication or other stuff. Just use the API.
-   **Thousands of images**: We have thousands of images (almost 3000) and we are adding more every day.
-   **Descriptive metadata**: We provide metadata for every image and gif.
-   **Official wrappers**: We provide free open-source API wrappers to speed up the implementation.

## Can I use Nekos API for commercial projects?

Yes, you can use Nekos API for commercial projects. We don't have any restrictions from us on that. However, <u>**_we are NOT the copyright holders of the images provided_**</u> and therefore we cannot license them to you. We try to provide the author of every image, but we can't guarantee that we have the correct information. If you want to use an image for commercial purposes, you should contact the author of the image.
